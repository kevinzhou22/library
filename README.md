## Library

Basic website built as JavaScript practice.

## Reflection

This project was initially meant to be a basic exercise in using constructors. While
that goal was achieved, what turned out to be more time-consuming was the process of working
with forms.

While I could have just pieced together a form for the modal window based off of what I already
know, I was interested in going deeper than that, and I spent quite a few hours reading
up on forms before making the modal window.

The generation of "cards" for representing the books in the library was also somewhat
frustrating. The process was straightforward, but the JavaScript code seems very
clunky, and I can't help but feel there's a better way to do it. Nevertheless,
I'll let that be for now.

Lastly, it was interesting to implement localStorage for the first time.
